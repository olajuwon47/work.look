         <img src="horse.jpeg" alt="This is a horse"><br> 
         <p>The horse(Equus ferus caballus) is a domesticated, one-toed, hoofed mammal.</p>
            <p>It belongs to the taxonomic family Equidae and is one of two extant subspecies of Equus ferus.</p>
            <p> The horse has evolved over the past 45 to 55 million years from a small multi-toed creature, close to Eohippus, into the large, single-toed animal of today.</p>
                <p> Humans began domesticating horses around 4000 BCE, and their domestication is believed to have been widespread by 3000 BCE.</p>
                    <p> Horses in the subspecies caballus are domesticated, although some domesticated populations live in the wild as feral horses.</p>   
        <img src="elephant.jpeg" alt="This is an elephant"><br>
        <p>Elephants are scattered throughout sub-Saharan Africa,</p>
        <p>South Asia, and Southeast Asia and are found in different habitats,</p>
        <p>including savannahs, forests, deserts, and marshes.</p>
            <p>They are herbivorous, and they stay near water when it is accessible.</p>
                <p> They are considered to be keystone species, due to their impact on their environments.</p>
                    <p> Elephants have a fissionâ€“fusion society, in which multiple family groups come together to socialise.</p>
                        <p>Females (cows) tend to live in family groups, which can consist of one female with her calves or several related females with offspring.</p>
                            <p>The leader of a female group, usually the oldest cow, is known as the matriarch. </p>
        <img src="koi fish.jpeg" alt="This is a pexel"><br> 
        <p> koi fish, also known as Nishikigoi, are a popular and cherished species of fish.</p>
            <p> These beautiful and colorful creatures bring tranquility and elegance to any pond or water garden.</p>
            <p> With their stunning patterns and vibrant colors, koi fish have become a symbol of beauty and good luck</p>.
                <p> While all koi fish share certain characteristics,</p>
                    <p>there are various types and breeds distinguished by their unique colors, scales, and patterns.</p>
                        <p> Let's take a closer look at some of the most popular.</p>
        <img src="ape-berber-monkey.jpeg" alt="This is a monkey"><br>
        <p>Monkey is a common name that may refer to most mammals of the infraorder Simiiformes,also known as the simians.</p>
            <p> Traditionally, all animals in the group now known as simians are counted as monkeys except the apes,
                <p>which constitutes an incomplete paraphyletic grouping; however,</p>
                    <p>in the broader sense based on cladistics, apes (Hominoidea) are also included,</p>
                        <p> making the terms monkeys and simians synonyms in regard to their scope. </p>
        <img src="lion.jpg" alt="this is a lion"><br>
        <p> The lion (Panthera leo) is a large cat of the genus Panthera native to Africa and India.</p>
        <p>  It has a muscular, broad-chested body; short, rounded head; round ears; and a hairy tuft at the end of its tail.</p>
        <p> It is sexually dimorphic; adult male lions are larger than females and have a prominent mane.</p>
        <p>   It is a social species, forming groups called prides.</p>
        <p> A lion's pride consists of a few adult males, related females, and cubs.</p>
        <p> Groups of female lions usually hunt together, preying mostly on large ungulates.</p>
        <p>The lion is an apex and keystone predator; although some lions scavenge when opportunities occur and have beenknown to hunt humans,</p>
        <p> lions typically do not actively seek out and prey on humans.</p>
